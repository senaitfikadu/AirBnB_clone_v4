Before starting the projectâ€¦

You will work on a codebase using Flasgger, you will need to install it locally first before starting the RestAPI:

$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-lxml
$ sudo pip3 install flask_cors # if it was not installed yet
$ sudo pip3 install flasgger

If the RestAPI is not starting, please read the error message. Based on the(ses) error message(s), you will have to troubleshoot potential dependencies issues.
